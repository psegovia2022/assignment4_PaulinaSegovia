// IMPORT THE MODULE

// COLLECT NUMBER 1, NUMBER 2, AND OPERATION FROM THE USER

// CHECK TO SEE WHAT OPERATION THEY'RE USING
// CALL THE APPROPRIATE FUNCTION

// In this part of the assignment you will build a simple calculator using the skills you’ve acquired 
// in regards to functions and modules. 
// You will ask the user for a number, a second number, 
// and then finally ask them what kind of operation they want to perform,
//  either add, subtract, multiply, or divide. Depending on what they select, 
//  you will perform that operation. 
//  To complete this part of the assignment follow the steps outlined here:

// 1.	Create a module that abstracts away the main calculation logic of your application. 
// This module will have a private function called calculate and expose four different functions
//  (add, subtract, multiply, and divide). 
//  The shell of this module with some basic instruction has already been outlined for you.


// 2.	In the main script, prompt the user for a number and store that in a variable. 
// Convert that to a number.

// 3.	Then, prompt the user for a second number and store that in a variable. 
// Convert that to a number.

// 4.	Finally, prompt the user for the operation they would like to perform 
// (add, subtract, multiply, divide) and store that in a variable.

// 5.	Use a switch statement to evaluate the operation parameter being passed in. 
// Depending on what it is, perform that operation by calling the appropriate function from the module.

// 6.	Display the result of the calculation within an alert.

// 7.	Figure out how to make it so that if the user doesn’t enter either add,
//  subtract, multiply, or divide, they are displayed an alert message telling them that.
//   Then you’ll have to rerun the application so that the application asks the user 
//   for the numbers and operation once more. 
//   You’ll have to add this functionality within a do while loop similarly how the labs were done
//    in the previous lecture.

import calculator from "./modules/calculator.js";

// console.log(calculator(number1, number2));


console.log(calculator());

// ***********   I don't know what is making this function NOT working!
// ***********   Zak, could you give me some feedback please?
